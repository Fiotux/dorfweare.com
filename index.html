			<h1>How to do All Minigames</h1>
			<p>Start with Soccer Heading and try to get not to many points so that you end up at a high place on the in game leaderboard.
If you are too high on the mini-game leaderboard the game needs more time to scroll up.
In Table Tilt you just have to wait till the 30 seconds end.
In Ski Jump I recommend just get much speed at the start and don't jump.
To be even faster you can jump on the balance board to get an error message that instantly ends this round but jumping on your balance board can break your balance board.
-Ski Slalom, just go down with much speed in a straight line.
-Penguin Slide, you just have to do the same as in Soccer Heading to get low on the in game leaderboard.
-Balance Bubble, you have to crush in a wall as fast as possible by going directly to the right.
-Lotus Focus, you have to move around very hard on the balance board to end the round in under one second.
-Tightrope Tension, starts on a house, and you have to walk off the house. As soon as you can fall you have to fall down.
Now we are at the Aerobic games.
-Hula Hoop, just get a few points, so the round is not starting over and let the hula-hoop fall to instantly end this round.
-Super Hula Hoop, it is basically the same as Hula Hoop
-Rhythm Boxing, get a few points to get not to high on the in game leaderboard.
-Basic Step and Basic Step are the same as Rhythm Boxing
-Run, in the run games you have to go as fast as possible to the goal without falling.
I recommend just shaking the Wii Remote to get speed and hold the tempo till the end.
It is important to not pass the trainer.</p>
